            I like to think of myself as a good person, before everything else. Many areas interest me, such as
            programming and web development,
            psychology, music, nature, sports and more.These many interests brought me to study a multi-disciplinary
            degree that combined
            computer science, psychology and neuroscience. My main (professional) interest is finding balance between
            different areas - such
            as the analytical, emotional and creative parts of our brain. My secret to balancing between my various
            interests is building
            websites that focus on different areas, with an underlying theme of web development.
        </p>

        <p class="lead pt-3 mx-1" style=" text-align: auto;">
            Nowadays I am maintaing several websites that I built from scratch,including the one you are visiting right
            now ðŸ˜‰ . My current
            job as a SEO manager helped me acquire knowledge about bringing websites to the first places on google
            search, so I decided to try
            and make the most of both the worlds of web development and SEO by coding and promoting my websites on my
            own.

        <p class="lead pt-3 mx-1" style=" text-align: auto;">
            Nevertheless, I'd be glad to find a full-time job as a programmer to enhance my coding skills. Helping
            different companies optimize
            and rennovate their websites is an interesting and diverse job, but it makes me feel like I'm missing out on
            the real action happening on the websites themselves. In addition to improving
            my programming abilities,
            I believe working as a programmer and having direct access to different assets could make me feel more
            impactful and meaningful at work.
