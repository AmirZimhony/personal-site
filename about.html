            I like to think of myself as a good person, before everything else. Many areas interest me, such as
            programming and web development,
            psychology, music, nature, sports and more.These many interests brought me to study a multi-disciplinary
            degree that combined
            computer science, psychology and neuroscience. My main (professional) interest is finding balance between
            different areas - such
            as the analytical, emotional and creative parts of our brain. My secret to balancing between my various
            interests is building
            websites that focus on different areas, with an underlying theme of web development.
        </p>

        <p class="lead pt-3 px-5 mx-1" style=" text-align: auto;">
            Nowadays I am maintaing several websites that I built from scratch,including the one you are visiting right
            now ðŸ˜‰ . My current
            job as a SEO manager helped me acquire knowledge about bringing websites to the first places on google
            search, so I decided to try
            and make the most of both the worlds of web development and SEO by coding and promoting my websites on my
            own. It is a very interesting and diverse challenge. 
        </p>

            Nevertheless, I'd be glad to find a full-time job as a programmer to make the most of my coding skills. I found myself
            missing the satisfaction of a successful debugging session and the dopamine spike you achieve when observing something 
            you have written come to life.  Helping
            different companies optimize
            and renovate their websites has its perks, but it doesn't include writing code. In addition to the beauty of making scripts 
            you have written solve problems and automate long tasks,
            I believe working as a programmer and having direct access to different assets could make me feel very
            impactful and meaningful at work.
